Challenge 2
I designed an interactive ordering system from a food truck menu, using the skills we learned in Python so far.
The adapted menu will allow customers to place an order, which includes storing the customer's order and printing the receipt with the total price of all items ordered. 
  1. Create an empty list
  2. Printed, prompt the customer to enter their selection from the menu, saving it as a variable
  3. Used input validation to check if the customer input
  4. Created while loop that prompts the customer if they would like to keep ordering
  5. Created for loops
  6. Calculate the total price of the order and displayed it to the customer. Making sure to multiply the price by the quantity in the list comprehension.
